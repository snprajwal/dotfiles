Never Gone

||Shoreline fading into darkness
  Saw the thunderstorm, cruel and heartless
  Wreak havoc it did, and raze the village
  down to dust, nothing left to pillage
  And as the swish of Death's cloak died down
  There came a lone voice, amidst the rubble thrown
  A tiny ripple in a stormy ocean
  Singing a song laden with emotion
  And as the candle of hope was lit
  Grieving for all the blood spilt
  Faith rose from the unknown canyon of misery
  Sweeping away all the mystery
  For whatever happened, the bow was drawn
  And the arrow would be fired, but never gone
  Wandering in the unknown reaches
  Waiting for a traveller, to whom it teaches
  Never lose heart, never give in to sorrow
  And shine like the Sun, bringing a new morrow.||

||O'er the mountains, under the valleys
  Ran the band of warriors, with weapons in trolleys
  Led by the valiant, noble liege
  Decked in armour, ready for siege
  Bonsais in body, behemoths in bravery
  They chanted "Don't worry, just don't worry"
  And as they hit the looming crags
  They fell, and medics with needles and rags
  Flooded the field, wet in bloody bath
  For there was a dragon, full of wrath
  Burning the soldiers in a ball of flame
  But not eating them, for 'twas too tame
  To commit such deeds, immoral and cruel
  Because it knew right and wrong so well
  Truth is just an illusion of perspective
  But so are lies, only more deceptive
  And as the flames licked the charred grass
  A lone archer raised a bow of brass
  And shot the arrow, tipped with malice
  His aim was true, it did not miss
  A deafening roar broke the deathly silence
  A pitiful repentance for all the past violence
  There is no bad, there is no good
  Simply do your best, like everyone should
  When it is time to ascend the stairs to heaven
  Or fall into hell, abode of the demon
  All your deeds torn down, laid bare
  With you as fragile as a strand of hair
  You learn that no matter how much you care
  It doesn't matter, nothing is actually there.||

||Twilight lit the grassy plains
  And brought with it torrential rain
  As the clouds came forth and burst
  Quenching the earth's eager thirst
  The farmboy gazed at the hillock yonder
  Open-mouthed and tried to ponder
  What ungodly beast arose
  From the planet's fiery hallows
  Day after day he thought and thought
  For no one until then had taught
  The secrets of the wondrous land
  Where life emerged, glorious and grand
  And as the weeks went on and on
  He fantasized about the spawn
  Of demons and daemons alike
  Until the illusion, so childlike
  Lifted and thus the world revealed
  The myriad mysteries once concealed
  And then the boy was quiet as night
  For life happened - and all was light.||

||As I gaze into the void
  And revel in the vastness
  I see the shining stars
  And marvel at their grandness
  I am shown and I see
  How small we are, a tiny pea
  But my heart flares with joy
  For I have you with me.||

||My eyes are weary
  The lids droop
  The whisper of night
  Calls me to recoup
  And as my head
  Lands on the pillow
  My mind a lake
  With wind blowing mellow
  All I think of
  Is you.||

||Shoreline fading into darkness
  Saw the thunderstorm, cruel and heartless
  Wreak havoc it did, and raze the village
  down to dust, nothing left to pillage
  And as the swish of Death's cloak died down
  There came a lone voice, amidst the rubble thrown
  A tiny ripple in a stormy ocean
  Singing a song laden with emotion
  And as the candle of hope was lit
  Grieving for all the blood spilt
  Faith rose from the unknown canyon of misery
  Sweeping away all the mystery
  For whatever happened, the bow was drawn
  And the arrow would be fired, but never gone
  Wandering in the unknown reaches
  Waiting for a traveller, to whom it teaches
  Never lose heart, never give in to sorrow
  And shine like the Sun, bringing a new morrow||

||O'er the mountains, under the valleys
  Ran the band of warriors, with weapons in trolleys
  Led by the valiant, noble liege
  Decked in armour, ready for siege
  Bonsais in body, behemoths in bravery
  They chanted "Don't worry, just don't worry"
  And as they hit the looming crags
  They fell, and medics with needles and rags
  Flooded the field, wet in bloody bath
  For there was a dragon, full of wrath
  Burning the soldiers in a ball of flame
  But not eating them, for 'twas too tame
  To commit such deeds, immoral and cruel
  Because it knew right and wrong so well
  Truth is just an illusion of perspective
  But so are lies, only more deceptive
  And as the flames licked the charred grass
  A lone archer raised a bow of brass
  And shot the arrow, tipped with malice
  His aim was true, it did not miss
  A deafening roar broke the deathly silence
  A pitiful repentance for all the past violence
  There is no bad, there is no good
  Simply do your best, like everyone should
  When it is time to ascend the stairs of heaven
  Or fall into hell, abode of the demon
  All your deeds torn down, laid bare
  With you as fragile as a strand of hair
  You learn that no matter how much you care
  It doesn't matter, nothing is actually there||

||Twilight lit the grassy plains
  And brought with it torrential rain
  As the clouds came forth and burst
  Quenching the earth's eager thirst
  The farmboy gazed at the hillock yonder
  Open-mouthed and tried to ponder
  What ungodly beast arose
  From the planet's fiery hallows
  Day after day he thought and thought
  For no one until then had taught
  The secrets of the wondrous land
  Where life emerged, glorious and grand
  And as the weeks went on and on
  He fantasized about the spawn
  Of demons and daemons alike
  Until the illusion, so childlike
  Lifted and thus the world revealed
  The myriad mysteries once concealed
  And then the boy was quiet as night
  For life happened - and all was light||

||Never trust a mirror
  For deep within your heart
  There resides a lovely soul
  Whose every thought and want
  Gets you closer to your goal
  Never trust a mirror
  It only shows you your looks
  But behind that adorable head
  There lies an ocean full of books
  Collections of trivia tucked away inside
  Waiting for a chance to roll on your tongue
  So many unknown facts and tales
  Ballads and legends unsung
  Never trust a mirror
  For it never shows the truth
  Darling you are the shining star
  Who makes me forget my ruth||

||As I gaze into the void
  And revel in the vastness
  I see the shining stars
  And marvel at their grandness
  I am shown and I see
  How small we are, a tiny pea
  But my heart flares with joy
  For I have you with me||

||My eyes are weary
  The lids droop
  The whisper of night
  Calls me to recoup
  And as my head
  Lands on the pillow
  My mind a lake
  With wind blowing mellow
  All I think of
  Is you||
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22/03/2021

||First thought in the morning
  The last one in the night
  Between the two, you're always on my mind
  O fair lady, when shall you free my heart
  From loving you so, while we are apart||
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

||I get through the sadness
  With you in my heart
  But when I'm happy, I miss you
  For we're apart||

||One time I met a girl
  Many ages ago
  Who made my eyes light up like lamps
  And set my face aglow
  She made my heartbeat race
  And my love for her soar
  The honeyed tones of her sweet voice
  Left me asking for more
  I made her smile and laugh
  And told her all my jokes
  Wove words into enchanting poems
  That painted vivid strokes
  We spoke from dawn to dusk
  Sharing all that we knew
  Our thoughts and dreams and ambitions
  And all our fears too
  With many mighty plans
  And royal goals in hand
  We ventured into unknown seas
  Leaving behind the sand
  Braving the raging storms
  Across turbulent seas
  We sailed until we sighted land
  Which put our minds at ease
  Alighting at the docks
  The earth beneath our feet
  We rejoiced in each other's arms
  And shared a kiss so sweet
  That if we were a star
  Our combined love would shine
  Illuming every corner of
  This universe divine
  One time I met a girl
  Who made my life so blessed
  Oh what can I say about her
  She simply is the best||

||Does one need a picture with their soul
  To realise how much they love it
  For darling, only you make me whole
  And every day my love grows, a little bit||

||I wake up at dawn to the
  Lilting tones of your voice
  Ornately laying their melodies
  Vividly in my mind
  Elusively haunting me from
  Yesterday to tomorrow
  Overflowing with a joy
  Unlike anything I can find||

||I see you come to me
  At the light of morn
  With your tousled tresses
  And a stifled yawn
  And all that I can think is
  You're so beautiful

  You slowly look at me
  Holding your coffee
  A wry smile on your lips
  As you smell my tea
  And all that I can think is
  You're so beautiful

  I walk in the sunshine
  With you by my side
  And gaze into your eyes
  Filled with golden light
  And all that I can think is
  You're so beautiful

  I listen to you talk
  In your lilting voice
  A melody so rich
  Music seems like noise
  And all that I can think is
  You're so beautiful

  You place your hand in mine
  Our fingers entwined
  Like two wandering souls
  That fortune aligned
  And all that I can think is
  You're so beautiful

  I gently wipe your tears
  For it's time to leave
  Return to solitude
  On this winter eve
  And all that I can think is
  You're so beautiful

  I hold you in my arms
  The love of my life
  The pain of letting go
  Stabbing like a knife
  And all that I can think is
  You're so beautiful

  I watch you walk away
  Holding back tears
  But my heart weeps freely
  Wishing you were here
  And all that I can think is
  You're so beautiful||

||You smiled, and it was magic
  With just a single glance
  Life was no longer tragic
  For you made my heart dance||

||I wake up in the morning
  And look to my right
  A calendar shows the date
  In the warm sunlight
  A nostalgic memory
  Floats into my head
  A lover from time long past
  A single untied thread
  With embraces and kisses
  A sweet enchanting laugh
  Is all I can remember
  A fitting epitaph
  For what was once so good
  And is no longer here
  All I can do is recall
  And shed a lonely tear||
